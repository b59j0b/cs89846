Assignment 1 – Design of members subjected to axial loads 

Figure   1: Sketch of steel support structure to   be designedFigure 1 illustrates a sketch of   a proposed pin-jointed triangulated steel truss structure of   dimensions L1 and L2 to support a given   load   P and Q.    You are   required to design   members, M1 (length   = L1 );   and M2 (length   = )
Assume: 
•            All   joints   are   pin-jointed
•          All nodes   are   assumed   to   be   fixed   from   movement   out-of-plane
•          All members   have   a   mid-point   restraint for   buckling   out-of-plane
•             Member M1 has a   net area   in tension   of 0.85 Ag 
Note: 
•             Choose any steel sections allowable   in   AS4100
•             State any further assumptions 
•          You   do   not   need to   design   the   connections,   merely   sketch   them   based   on   your   chosen   sectionDesign Parameters: Your student   number   is of the form. zABCDXYZ and   the   parameters for   your   design   are   given   in   Table   1.    For example,   if your student   number   is z5412345, then   the   parameters   for   your   design   are   given   by   your   last   student number Z   as   5.L1 = 4.Y   m   = 4.4   mL2 = 4.X   m   = 4.3   mP =   700   kN
Q =   750   kN

Marking Scheme 
The following table provides the overall marking criteria for   Assignment   1
1.       Calculate the   member forces   using   principles   of statics
2.         Determine the reactions using the   principles   of statics
3.         Design   member, M1 using   AS4100
4.         Determine the elongation of member M1 using mechanics of   materials   principles
5.         Design   member, M2 using   AS4100
6.         Provide sketches and drawings of the members and   connections   and   how this   would   be   constructed.      Please   provide comments.    You do   not need to design the connections,   however   provide   sketches   showing the
sections and scale of the members and connections.   Provide comments   on   the   design   and   optimisation.
